# ORQ8 Changelog

## 2026-09 — Company Health (T-01..T-04)

- New `services/company-health.ts`: deterministic 0-100 composite score from 6
  weighted live factors (goals, tasks, workforce, approvals, credits,
  connectors), each with explainable reasons ordered critical > warning > positive > info.
  Pure helpers (scoreGoals/scoreTasks/scoreWorkforce/scoreApprovals/scoreCredits/
  scoreConnectors/computeHealth) are unit-tested; the live aggregate
  getCompanyHealth() is org-scoped on every query and reuses anomaly-detector
  thresholds + reliability profiles + org-state aggregation.
- New `GET /v1/health` (requireAuth, org-scoped) + web proxy `/api/health`.
- New `/app/health` founder page: score ring, "why this score" reasons, factor
  breakdown with weights; sidebar entry under Command.
- 25 unit tests (thresholds, spikes, determinism, weighting, reason ordering).
- Master plan created: docs/ORQ8_IMPLEMENTATION_MASTER_PLAN.md (resumable ledger).
